# Intruder-Tools

**What is this?**

It's a set of tools that aim to make your mapmaking using the [Intruder Map Maker tools](https://sharklootgilt.superbossgames.com/wiki/index.php/IntruderMM) easier!

**What does it includes?**

Right now:


 **1. Draw ZipLine in Editor**
 
Tired of trying to imagine what your zipline would look like? Imagine no more! 
	 
 **2. Recollider**
 
Tired of having to manually add colliders to your objects by hand? Just select their parent and this tool will set them all as static & add colliders!
	 
 3. **Disable broken CSGs**
	 
Use this on your CSG parent and it will detect and deactivate all of your CSGs that are stopping your baking!
	 

**How to install?**
Just grab this UnityPackage and add it to your project! You'll get a new menu like so!

 *Thanks to MitchyD for lending me his broken CSG to have a good way to test the script out!*
