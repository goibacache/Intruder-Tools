# Intruder-Tools

**What is this?**

It's a set of tools that aim to make your mapmaking using the [Intruder Map Maker tools](https://sharklootgilt.superbossgames.com/wiki/index.php/IntruderMM) easier!

# What does it includes?

Right now:


 **1. Draw ZipLine in Editor**
 
Tired of trying to imagine what your zipline would look like? Imagine no more! 
Just add it to your zipline object!
 
 **2. Disable broken CSGs**
	 
Use this on your CSG parent and it will detect and deactivate all of your CSGs that are stopping your baking!
Just select your Parent CSG and use the menu option!
	 


# How to install?


Just grab this UnityPackage and add it to your project! You'll get a new menu like so!
